# Predictive-Model-Data-Science-Salaries

This project delves into a data set of job postings in the data science industry. My goal with this project was to uncover insights about factors that impact salaries in this industry, which I achieved by exploring relationships between experience levels, company size, and job titles using Python. 

The first portion of this project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) supplemented by data visualizations, and the second portion consists of a predictive linear regression model, created in an attempt to predict salary based off of categorical variables given in the data set.

Summary visualizations and findings:
